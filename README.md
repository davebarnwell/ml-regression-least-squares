# Linear Regression class

A Linear regression class that uses the least squares method to approximate a straight line to a data set
with some example test data to run it against. The class is called \MachineLearning\Regression\LeastSquares.

The example uses composer to generate the class auto loader even though there are no dependencies, as in a larger project
you'd include with composer.

The example usage can be run using the following:-

    cd examples
    php example.php
    
    
The example reads from a CSV file in tests/data/ which has a couple of years of data in.
